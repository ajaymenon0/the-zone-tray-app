# The Zone Tray App
White noise tray App based off https://beinthe.zone/

This is a simple white noise app that sits in the tray with volume and sharpness(freq cuttoff) controls.

I used white noise predominantly while working to help me with focus issues.
I do resort to Lofi-hiphop when doing lighter work, so do plan to extend this to make a LoFi Generator switch in the future.
