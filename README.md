This is a simple white noise app that sits in the tray with volume and sharpness(freq cuttoff) controls.

I use white noise predominantly while working to help me with focus issues.

I do resort to Lofi-hiphop when doing lighter work, so do plan to extend this to make a Lofi Generator switch in the future.

The latest version of the app would be available in the [releases section](https://github.com/ajaymenon0/the-zone-tray-app/releases)

#### ⚠️ Heads up
Since I haven't added an Apple certificate to the app it'll throw scary warnings on the first run.
Please do follow [these steps](https://www.macworld.com/article/672947/how-to-open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer.html) in order to give this app a clean chit to run.
